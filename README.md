# Multi-Dimensional-Chords

A novel synthesis algorithm designed to explore the non-duality of pitch and rhythm, both of which are fundamentally frequency.

Both the frequencies of the tones that make up the multi-dimensional chord and the rhythms at which those tones are played are derived from the same ratios.

This process can be used to voice any intervals or chords, but works particularly well with ones related by simple ratios, such as those from just tunings, as otherwise the rhythms of the tones will get out of sync (like when using intervals and chords from 12 Tone Equal Temperament).


Examples
To consider a simpler example of the multi-dimensional interval of an octave (1 : 2), the two tones might have pitches of A3, at 220 Hz, and A4, at 440 Hz (220 : 440) === (1 : 2). In this case, the lower A3 note would be played at a rhythm of once per second, while A4 would then be played twice per second (1 : 2).

As an example of a multi-dimensional chord, consider a (just intoned) minor triad with ratios (1 : 6/5 : 3/2) === (1 : 1.2 : 1.5). If we play the chord with a fundamental tone of 180 Hz, the third and the fifth are at 216 and 270 Hz respectively. These tones are all played on a rhythm that is based on these very same ratios (1 : 1.2 : 1.5), so if the fundamental sounds 1 time per second, then the third will sound 1.2 times per second, and the fifth at 1.5 times per second. So the rhythms and the frequencies of these tones are both defined by the same ratios, hence my term multi-dimensional chords.
A 10 second sample of this minor triad multi-dimensional chord played with a fundamental of 180 Hz and a fundamental rhythm of 3 BPS is included. (MDC Minor Triad 180Hz 3BPS.wav)
